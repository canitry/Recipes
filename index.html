    <p>note: There's this youtuber benjaminthebaker.
    He gives really thorough information on how changing different aspects of a recipe changes the final result for baking.
    Check him out if you're wondering how certain substituations or the quirks of <em>how</em> you bake might influence <em>what</em> you baked.
