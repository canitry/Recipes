        Instructions
        <ol>
            <li>If the shrimp is frozen, place in the refrigerator to defrost a few hours prior</li>
            <li>Run the shrimp under cold water a few times then peel the shrimp, saving the shell.</li>
            <li>Slice the garlic into thin slices, around a millimeter in thickness.</li>
            <li>Generously salt a pot of water (the amount of salt two fingers and a thumb will pick up) and place it on the stove on high heat till it boils.</li>
            <li>When it boils, place the pasta in the pot and cook for 11 minutes <i>(or how you generally cook pasta)</i>.</li>
            <li>When the pasta is done, strain the pasta so it doesn't bloat
                <ul>
                    <li>If you would like to use the pasta water in the sauce, keep the pasta water</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Place a pan on heat.</li>
            <li>Once it heats up, put in oil.</li>
            <li>Lower the heat and add the garlic and pepper to the pan, stir, making sure they do not burn.</li>
            <li>When the garlic has browned, add the shrimp shells</li>
            <li>When the shrimp shells have reddened, add the shrimp, along with salt, pepper, and your pat of butter.</li>
            <li>When the shrimp is thoroughly cooked, remove the shrimp and set off to the side, and add some water (preferrably pasta water) with the chicken stock dissolved into it
                <ul>
                    <li>You may also want to remove the pepper</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Reduce the water in the pan till it becomes a saucy consistency, when reduced, remove the shells and add the shrimp back in
                <ul>
                    <li>If you want the sauce to become richer, you could add more water and wait till reduced again</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Add the pasta into the sauce and add a spoonful of pesto, toss until incorporated.</li>
            <li>Plate your finished pasta and garnish with grated Parmesan</li>
        </ol>
