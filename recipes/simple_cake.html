        Instructions
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk your egg yolks till it becomes liquid, add the milk and melted butter and mix</li>
            <li>In a different bowl, whip your egg whites, when big bubbles form, add the sugar in 3 parts till it becomes a meringue.</li>
            <li>Sift your dry ingredients into the meringue and fold (we're trying to prevent air loss).</li>
            <li>Carefully fold in the egg yolk mixture into the meringue.
                <ul>
                    <li>I recommend mixing a bit of the egg white mixture into the egg yolk mixture then putting the resulting mixture into the egg white mixture to fold.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Pour the batter into your pan (line with parchment or butter) and hit the bottom of the pan lightly against the table to get rid of any air bubbles.</li>
            <li>Bake in a 180&deg;C (&deg;F) oven for 35-40 minutes (check with a toothpick).</li>
        </ol>
